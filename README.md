1.Cancer is a serious health problem and one of the primary diseases leading to morbidity and mortality in the world [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b1)]. Chemoradiotherapy is currently the primary treatment option for patients with advanced cancer but can be limited due to severe side effects and drug resistance [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b2)]. Therefore, developing new therapies to overcome the disadvantages is extremely required.

Cancer immunotherapy has been recently developed with the aim of designing effective treatments to improve the specificity and strength of the immune system against cancer [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b3)]. James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the 2018 Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine for discovering a cancer treatment by suppressing negative immunomodulation. Their research on the immune checkpoints programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), demonstrated that they acted as a “brake” role in immune function, and suggested that immune checkpoint inhibition may reactivate T cells and eliminate cancer cells more effectively [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b4)]. An increasing number of studies report that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be of significant therapeutic value.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the inhibition of PD-1 promotes an effective immune response against cancer cells [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b5)]. PD-1 signaling pathway suppression has shown that the clinical response of patients with different solid tumors and hematological malignancies, mainly relies on T-cells effectively to penetrating the tumor [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b6)]. In addition, targeting PD-L1 has been associated with a significant clinical response in a wide range of cancer patients [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b7)]. The purpose of the present review was to elucidate the role of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in cancer, aiming to provide novel anticancer therapeutic strategies in the future.

PD-1/PD-L1 pathway controls the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment. The activity of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 are responsible for T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic secretion in cancer to degenerating anti-tumor immune responses.

### PD-1

PD-1, also referred to as CD279, was first discovered in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-deprived LyD9 (murine hematopoietic progenitor) and 2B4-11 (murine T-cell hybridoma) cell lines in 1992 [[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b8)]. PD-1 is 15% similar to the amino acid sequence of CD28, 20% similar to CTLA4, and 13% similar to induced T-cell co-stimulator [[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b9)]. PD-1 is a 55-kDa transmembrane protein containing 288 amino acids with an extracellular N-terminal domain (IgV-Like), a membrane-permeating domain and a cytoplasmic tail located at the N and C ends, respectively, with two tyrosine base [[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b10)].

PD-1 is an inhibitor of both adaptive and innate immune responses, and is expressed on activated T, natural killer (NK) and B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes [[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b11)]. Of note, PD-1 is highly expressed on tumor-specific T cells [[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b11)]. Transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NOTCH, Forkhead box protein (FOX) O1 and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) may trigger the transcription of PD-1 [[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b12)]. The conserved upstream regulatory regions B and C (CR-B and COR-C) are important for the expression of the PD-1 gene. There is a binding site in the CR-C region that is connected to NFATc1 (NFAT2) in TCD4 and TCD8 units [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b13)]. Instead, c-FOS connects to sites in the CR-B region and enhances PD-1 expression when it stimulates T-cell receptors upon Ag detection in naive T cells [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b13)]. NFATc is activated and binds to the promoter region of the pdcd1 gene [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b13)]. In addition, IFN-α combined with IRF9 may result in PD-1 expression via binding to the promoter of the pdcd1 gene in exhausted T cells [[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b14)]. During chronic infections, PD-1 is expressed in exhausted TCD8 cells due to its demethylated promoter, and the FOXO1 transcription factor binds to the PD-1 promoter to increase its expression [[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b14)]. Cancer cell leakage increases the expression of the c-FOS subunit of AP1, thereby increasing the expression of PD-1 [[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b15)].

PD-1 plays two opposing roles, as it can be both beneficial and harmful. As regards its beneficial effects, it plays a key role in reducing the regulation of ineffective or harmful immune responses and maintaining immune tolerance. However, PD-1 causes the dilation of malignant cells by interfering with the protective immune response [[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b16)].

### PD-L1

PD-1 ligand (PD-L1; also referred to as CD279 and B7-H1), belongs to the B7 series and is a 33-kDa type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that contains 290 amino acids with Ig- and IgC domains in its extracellular region [[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b17)].

PD-L1 is usually expressed by macrophages, some activated T cells and B cells, DCs and some epithelial cells, particularly under inflammatory conditions [[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b18)]. In addition, PD-L1 is expressed by tumor cells as an “adaptive immune mechanism” to escape anti-tumor responses [[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b19)]. PD-L1 is associated with an immune environment rich in CD8 T cells, production of Th1 cytokines and chemical factors, as well as interferons and specific gene expression characteristics [[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b20)]. It has been demonstrated that IFN-γ causes PD-L1 upregulation in ovarian cancer cells, which is responsible for disease progression, whereas IFN-γ receptor 1 inhibition can reduce PD-L1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia mouse models through the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and MYD88/TRAF6 pathways [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b21)]. IFN-γ induces protein kinase D isoform 2 (PKD2), which is important for the regulation of PD-L1. Inhibition of PKD2 activity inhibits the expression of PD-L1 and promotes a strong antitumor immune response. NK cells secrete IFN-γ through the Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 pathways, increasing the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of the tumor cells [[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b22)]. Studies on melanoma cells have shown that IFN-γ secreted by T cells through the JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT2/STAT3-IRF1 pathway may regulate the expression of PD-L1. T and NK cells appear to secrete IFN-γ, which induces PD-L1 expression on the surface of the target cells, including tumor cells [[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b23)].

PD-L1 acts as a pro-tumorigenic factor in cancer cells via binding to its receptors and activating proliferative and survival signaling pathways [[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b24)]. This finding further indicated that PD-L1 is implicated in subsequent tumor progression. In addition, PD-L1 has been shown to exert non-immune proliferative effects on a variety of tumor cell types. For example, PD-L1 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell-like phenotypes in renal cancer cells, indicating that the presence of the intrinsic pathway of PD-L1 promotes kidney cancer progression [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136921/#b25)].





2.

Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) signaling is commonly hijacked by cancer cells to escape immune surveillance [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR1)]. When PD-1 and T cell receptor (TCR) bind to their ligands, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif of PD-1 are phosphorylated [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR2)]. Subsequently, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP-2) is recruited and activated, reversing the phosphorylation of downstream signaling of TCR and CD28 [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR3), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR4)]. Besides inhibiting some early activating pathways of T cells, PD-1 directly undermines antigen recognition by disrupting the trimolecular interaction of TCR-pMHC-CD8 [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR5)]. As a result, PD-1 signaling suppresses T cell functions, including activation, proliferation, and cytokine production [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR6)]. At present, antibodies blocking PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1 have been approved to treat various solid and hematologic malignancies (Table [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/table/Tab1/)) [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR7)–[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR12)]. Although α-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies exhibit potent antitumor effects in some patients, most patients could not benefit from α-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments, owing to primary or acquired treatment resistance [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR13)]. For the non-responders, PD-1 signaling is not the speed-limiting rheostat of cancer-immunity cycle, and it is insufficient to revive antitumor immunity by blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 [[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR14)].

Apart from PD-1 signaling, other immune checkpoints, abnormal angiogenesis, immunosuppressive immune cells or cytokines, cancer-associated adipocytes, and hyperactive cancer-associated fibroblasts also modulate cancer-immune set point and promote immune tolerance [[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR15)–[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR20)]. Logically, removing these negative factors could enhance the therapeutic effect of α-PD-1/PD-L1 and relieve drug resistance. On the other hand, some positive factors such as immunogenic cancer cell death, immunosupportive cytokines, and professional antigen presentation cells (pAPCs) contribute to immune clearance [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR21)]. Correspondingly, strengthening these positive elements might boost the cancer-immune cycle, drive the transformation from cold to hot tumors, and improve the response to α-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR21)].

The combination strategy is deemed as a rational and feasible approach to achieve optimal treatment effects. Accumulating evidence indicates that chemotherapy, radiotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), epigenetic modulators, or other immunomodulators could synergize α-PD-1/PD-L1, by enhancing cancer antigen release, APC function, or effector activity [[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR22)–[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8780712/#CR31)]. In this review, we summarized the synergistic effects of combination immunotherapies and the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, given the development of antibody technology, we also introduced the emerging bispecific or bifunctional antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.



3.Immune checkpoint molecules work as protective factors for the body's immune system, for instance, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), galectin-9 (Gal-9), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) can regulate the immune system to an appropriate intensity to avoid autoimmune responses caused by excessive activated immune cells [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR1)]. However, when immune checkpoint molecules are overexpressed or overactivated, immune function is inhibited. By taking advantage of this phenomenon, tumor cells that excessively activate immune checkpoint molecules prevent local immune cells from escaping surveillance and clearance, thus accelerating tumor growth.

The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway was discovered relatively early. In the tumor microenvironment, activated T cells express high levels of PD-1, which induce the expression of PD-L1 in local tissues by causing the release of cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukins (ILs), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR2)]. Upregulated PD-L1 prevents excessive activation of T cells, maintains the immune system’s tolerance to self-antigens, and reduces the immune response against the surrounding normal tissue after combining with PD-1 on T cells via protein–protein interactions. Therefore, blocking the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 can reverse immunosuppressive conditions and improve the killing of tumor cells by the body’s immune cells. In 2014, nivolumab, the first PD-1 monoclonal antibody drug, was approved to treat melanoma [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR3), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR4)]. In recent years, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR5)], avelumab [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR6), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR7)], and durvalumab [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR7), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR8)], have also shown positive responses in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies, including melanoma, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, and skin Merkel cell carcinoma (Table [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/table/Tab1/)).

However, antibody drugs are associated with several disadvantages, such as immunogenicity issues and the poor permeability of tumor tissues, which lead to the overall low response rate of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs [[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR9)]. Tumor cells continually activate the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway by overexpressing PD-L1 to trigger multiple immune suppression mechanisms. From this perspective, this binding can also be interrupted by inhibiting the expression of PD-L1 or promoting its degradation. Increasing research is devoted to intervening in the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway by applying small molecule compounds such as peptides and peptidomimetics to address this problem. The first multipeptide human PD-1 (hPD-1) inhibitor, AUNP-12, reported in 2014, was jointly developed by Aurigene and Pierre Fabre Laboratories in India [[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR10)]. Bristol-Myers squibb (BMS) and Curis Pharmaceuticals have developed BMS-202 and CA-170, which interrupt the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 [[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR11), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921448/#CR12)]. Currently, these small molecular compounds are in the preclinical research stage. In this review, we first describe the formation of tumor escape mechanisms based on immune checkpoints and briefly summarize the efficacy and limitations of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and the necessity to develop small molecule drugs. Finally, we introduce small molecule drugs based on three different therapeutic methods of targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway.
